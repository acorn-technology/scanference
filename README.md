A client side only webpage that can scan qr codes.

The idea is that the user opens a webpage.
You get your unique QR code that show on the start page.

You can open the camera to scan others QR code from users that uses the same app.

When scanning it will look into a table to find a key that is made up by (your qr-code + their qr-code) and that will return a value.
The value is a free text string that we will define.
